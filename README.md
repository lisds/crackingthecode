Hello and welcome to Cracking the Code!

This module will introduce you to the Python programming language. It is expressly designed for learners who have no (or very little) experience with coding. At all points, the emphasis will be on making you proficient with the fundamental features of Python. Subsequent modules will build on this knowledge.

The module has two live online sessions that run back to back on Tuesday with half hour break in between (13.00-14.30 and 15.00-16.30). Use the menu on the left for each session, i.e. 

1.1. = Week 1, Session 1 (Tuesday 13.00-14.30)

1.2 = Week 1, Session 2 (Tuesday 15.00-16.30) etc

Class Learning Objectives
On completion of the module, participants should be able to:

Understand the concepts and data structures of Python 
Write and debug code in a way that reflects best practice
Automate routine computational tasks
Utilise coding libraries as appropriate
Expectations 
Coding ability is built through practice. Students are expected to actively build up their expertise by proactively attempting coding exercises they find online and elsewhere. Equally, they should aim to become proficient at finding the errors in their code and addressing them autonomously. Whilst language models like ChatGPT can be useful for understanding code, they can be very damaging for students who have no or little knowledge of Python. This is because they can quickly become a crutch as the student becomes dependent on the AI. For this module, students are expected to become proficient in basic Python without needing to rely on these tools.

 

## Grading Scheme 
You will be asked to submit three Python notebooks. These will be graded as follows:

A = 90-100

B = 80-89

C = 70-79

D = 60-69

F = 59 and below
